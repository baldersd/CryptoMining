<h1># CryptoMining # Useful tools for Crypto Mining in Ubuntu</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The idea here is to make a mini portal for building a rig and setting up a miner with some fault tolerance to mine various crypto currencies.  
</p>
<p>There is no support arm to this, the idea is it can get you a basic NVIDIA Ubuntu rig up and running and you tweak the bash scripts...etc...to suit your setup. If I can help answer any questions you might have you can send these to baldersd@hotmail.com happy to take a look!</p>
<h2>Linux Blend</h2>
<p>After trialling various blends of Ubuntu and other I have found under my test cases anyway that Ubunt with MATE gui (x64) proved to be the most stable and didnt give the usual grief with NVIDIA Overclocking settings (coolbits). All this works really well for me.

<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>If any of this has saved you some time and effort and you are willing to make a small donation I would of course be very grateful however I don't expect anyone to feel obliged to do so as this is free usage for all. Up to you.</p>
